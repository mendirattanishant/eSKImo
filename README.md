# eSKImo
The purpose of this project is to build an Android app that allows skiers to connect with other skiers and sync up on events. The app will let you create your own “skiing” profile. User’s profile picture, events, current location, ski score and other profile information will be stored. A user can create a ski event where he can set the start location, the ski path and the time at which the event will start. Once the user saves the event, he can invite other users by browsing existing user profiles. When the event starts, participants will be able to view each other’s location in real time. This will help skiers in knowing how others are doing during the event. Users will also be able to track lap times privately. They will be provided with a stopwatch inside the app, which they can use to record lap times. After the completion of an event, the user will be able to trace his path on a map, view the distance he has travelled and view the progress of other users.
